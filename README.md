## Quarto chatbot

This chatbot outputs all its responses in the form of Quarto documents.

It saves all responses to an output directory, which you can configure with `QUARTO_DS_CHATBOT_OUTPUT_DIR`.

You can specify the provider using `QUARTO_DS_CHATBOT_PROVIDER` but only `openai` is supported for now. Anthropic support coming soon!
